# Public Regulatory Documentation for BVLOS UAS Operations  
**Supplementary Material for Journal Publication**

## Overview

This repository contains **public, redacted copies of regulatory documents** used to support **Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS)** operations conducted as part of the **WildDrone** research activities in Kenya.

The documents are shared as **reference material** to improve transparency and reproducibility of the research presented in the associated journal paper. All files have been carefully reviewed and modified to remove sensitive, personal, operational, or security-relevant information.

These materials are **not official templates**, nor are they intended to represent universally applicable or regulator-approved formats. They reflect one specific operational and regulatory context and are provided to support academic discussion and methodological insight.

## Purpose of This Repository

The objectives of sharing these documents are to:

- Provide concrete examples of how BVLOS regulatory documentation can be structured  
- Support reproducibility and peer review of safety-driven UAS field trials  
- Illustrate how the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology can be translated into real permit applications  
- Contribute to open research practices in UAS operations and regulation  

This repository is intended for **researchers, regulators, operators, and students** working with risk-based approval processes for UAS operations.

## Scope and Limitations

Please note the following:

- All documents are **public copies** with redactions  
- Regulatory requirements vary significantly between jurisdictions  
- These documents should **not** be reused verbatim for permit applications  

Users are expected to consult their **competent aviation authority** for authoritative guidance.

## Repository Contents

### 1. UAS Type and Platform Documentation  
**`KCAA_UAS_TYPE_Document_Public.pdf`**

A template version of a UAS platform description submitted to the aviation authority. It outlines:

- UAS configuration and characteristics  
- Intended operational use  
- High-level system descriptions  

This document illustrates how technical platform information can be presented in a regulatory context.

---

### 2. Temporary Import Permit  
**`Temporary_Import_Permit_Public.pdf`**

An example of documentation used to temporarily import UAS equipment for research operations. It demonstrates:

- Typical information requested by customs and aviation authorities  
- Alignment between logistics, operations, and regulatory compliance  

---

### 3. BVLOS Operational Permit  
**`BVLOS_Operational_Permit_Public.pdf`**

A redacted example of an operational authorisation for BVLOS activities. The document shows:

- Permit structure and scope  
- Operational constraints and validity  
- The relationship between safety claims and authorisation conditions  

---

### 4. Operational Guidelines  
**`WD_Operational_Guidelines_Feb_2025_Public.pdf`**

Internal operational guidance adapted for public release. It includes:

- Crew roles and responsibilities  
- High-level procedures  
- Safety and coordination principles  

This document illustrates how organisational procedures support regulatory compliance.

---

### 5. BVLOS Application Package  
**`WD_BVLOS_Application_2025_Public.pdf`**

A consolidated BVLOS application submitted to the aviation authority, including:

- Concept of Operations (ConOps)  
- Ground and air risk considerations  
- References to SORA-based safety arguments  

This file provides the most complete illustration of how multiple safety and operational elements are brought together into a single application.
